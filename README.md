# Spotify-Recreation
A webpage that imitates the non-logged in Spotify homepage. I built this project to work on my css skills and learn flex-box. Through this project I also learned about svg's and how to manipulate them in css effectively. In addition, I also learned a lot about new html tags and really focused on using as specific of a tag as I could rather than just using divs everywhere.
